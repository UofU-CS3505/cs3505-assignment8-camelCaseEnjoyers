# Sprite Editor
by Emma, Isaac, Bradley, JianJian, Manya, and Josh 

## Description
The sprite editor allows for the easy creation, modification, and export of sprites. Our editor allows users set the size of the sprite they'd like to create, adjust the number of frames in the sprite animation, modify each pixel on the sprite, adjust the color being drawn, preview the sprite animation, and save and load sprite projects. We also implemented 2 extra features, those being a color palette and exporting the sprite as a png.

## Extra Features
### Color Palette
The sprite editor has a color palette that saves the last 5 most recently used colors, allowing users to easily swap between them.

### Export as PNG
Our editor allows users to export their current Sprite as a png, so they can utilize their work in other programs.
